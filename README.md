I had to make a new repo because my last one, that I had been working on until now, was acting up, not letting me push up, but also not allowing me to pull down and merge the remote changes. 
Had some trouble with local file management that might have accounted for this, it didnt like me pushing up from a different folder than it had been initialised with. It was easier to just make a new repo and use that,
which is why this repo is young. I didnt lose anything though, since the last push was just a functioning API call which I've since built on.
